If you play World of Warcraft, you best know me as TomCat.

I've been creating addons since early BfA for the love of the game and as a means to try to earn a living.

I've worked in software development for the majority of my 30-year career, but due to living with myalgic encephalomyelitis, it's become increasingly difficult to find work where I can get fair payment for my skills while accommodating my illness.  Employers like to be able to keep tabs on their employees and for them to have good attendance and arrive to meetings.  I often cannot do this due to having an inconsistent sleep schedule and fluctuating energy and focus levels.  This doesn't affect the quality of my work whatsoever.

Providing addons to the World of Warcraft community seemed to be a reasonable way to go, but this only works when the community is willing to provide support.  I needed to earn on average 1.8 cents per download (or about 22 cents per person) on my main addon in order to pay my bills.  A small number of supporters have provided about 6-7% of this.  The rest has had to come from my savings, retirement funds, and credit cards.  **I've recently run out of money and available credit**.  I desperately need your help... not only to cover costs so that I can sustainably develop addons, but to cover at least some of the shortages that have built up over time.

Please consider sponsoring, but even if you are unable to, definitely please let others who play the game know about this.
